### Soil Moisture Profile 

Virtical soil moisture profile development using statistical models:
  - The Exponential Model and 
  - The Principle of Maximum Entropy (POME) model 

The Exponentail model is based on the exponential decay function, mimicing the the time-lag relationship between the soil mositure at the surface with the bottom layers. The model depends upon a pre-defined relation (T) between the two layers and performs well under moist conditions (low evapotranspiration effects) and shallow depths. The model captures a temporal variations in moisture conidtions. The only input needed for the model is the surface moisture content value and a long-term (at least one year) record to compute 'T'. For details refers to Wagner et al., (1999) and Albergel et al., (2008)

The POME model on the other hand develops a vertical soil moisture profile is based on maximising the entropy. The maximization of entropy characterizes the diffusion of moisture through the soil column as a function of time. Unlike exponential model, the POME does not depend upon the any a-priori information about the nature or kind of relation between the layers. The method guarantees the minimum variance unbiased profile subject to bopundary conditions. The model needs three inputs: the surface and bottom moisture content (boundary conditions) and the soil column mean soil moisture value.
